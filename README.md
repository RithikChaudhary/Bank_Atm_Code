# Bank_Atm_Code
This program was created along with the QT Designer application in order to reduce the needs for tedious tasks such as designing a UI from scratch. For this application, my goal was to develop a further understanding of object-oriented programming as I find the possibilities with it to be far greater in terms of creating more sophisticated programs. Furthermore, learning how classes interact with each other is a valuable skill to learn for any programming language as well as help organize my code in the future.

For the future, I want to add features such as creating a database that stores various accounts that are created along with the option to create a new account using a separate window that can be opened by the user. I want to potentially use SQL to store the data if possible, and if not, just use an excel file and work with it through openpyxl.

Thanks for checking out this project and have a great day!
