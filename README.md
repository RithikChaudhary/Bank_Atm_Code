# Bank_Atm_Code
This program was created along with the QT Designer application in order to reduce the needs for tedious tasks such as designing a UI from scratch. For this application, my goal was to develop a further understanding of object oriented programming as I find the possibilities with it to be far greater in terms of creating more sofisticated programs. Furthermore, learning how classes interact with each other is a valuble skill to learn for any programming language as well as help organize my code in the future. 

Thanks for checking out this project and have a great day!
